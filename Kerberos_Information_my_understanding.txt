3 pairs of steps: -

1st -
	User:- Client Authentication to AS (Authentication Server) i.e., User_id and password
	KDC (Key Distribution System):- 
		Msg A:- Session Key encrypted using secret key of user (Secret key is generated by hashing the password of the user found at the database).
		Msg B:- "Session Key + client + address + validity" = TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) is encrypted using secret Key of TGS (Ticket Granting Server).
2nd - 
	User:- 
		Msg C:- Msg B
		Msg D:- "client + timestamp" is encrypted with Session Key
	KDC (Key Distribution System):-
		Msg E:- "Client-Server Key + client + address + validity" is encrypted using Service Server's Secret Key
		Msg F:- "Client-Server Key" encrypted using decrypted session Key
3rd - 
	User:- 
		Msg G:- Msg E
		Msg H:- "Client + timestamp" is encrypted using Client-Server Key
	Service Server:- 
		Msg I:- "Msg H's Timestamp" is encrypted using Client-Server Key

Process:-

1. Client enters Username and password and send's it to the website.
2. First those credentials will be sent to the Key Distribution Center (KDC).
3. KDC will check those credentials in its database.

4. If Matched,
5. Then, Authentication Server (AS) (which is inside KDC) will generate a Session Key.
6. AS will create 2 message:- 
	i. Session Key encrypted with the hash value generated by the hash value of the user password.
	ii. "Session Key + Client + Address + Validity" = Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) is encrypted using the Secret Key of Ticket Granting Server (TGS).
7. Those 2 messages will be sent tobe sent to the Client by the AS.
8. Then Client will decrypt 1st message in the previous 2 messages using the same hash value as key. That hash value will be generated by hashing the password and again hashing the hash value. In that way Client will get the Session Key.
9. From that the Client will get Session Key.
10. Then Client will send the following 2 messages to the KDC:-
	i. Then Client will Send the 2nd message from the previous 2 message directly without any changes.
	ii. And Client will send "Client + Timestamp" encrypted with the Session Key to the KDC.
11. Those 2 messages will be sent to Ticket Granting Server (TGS).
12. TGS will decrypted the 1st message from the previous 2 messages with its Secret Key. From that the TGS will get the Session Key.
13. Now TGS will decrypt the 2nd message from the previous 2 messages. And gets the Client details and cross check that Client with the Client of the 1st messages of the previous 2 messages.

14. If Matched,
15. Then, TGS will generate a Client-Server Key.
16. And TGS will send the following 2 messages to the Client:-
	i. "Client-Server Key + Client + Address + Validity" encrypted using Service Server's Secret Key
	ii. "Client-Server Key" encrypted using the Session Key which was found on decrypting the 1st message of the previous 2 messages
17. Client will decrypt the 2nd message from the previous 2 messages using its Session Key.
18. By that Client will get the Client-Server Key.
19. Now Client will send the following 2 messages to the Service Server:-
	i. 1st message from the previous 2 messages directly.
	ii. "Client + Timestamp" encrypted using the decrypted Client-Server Key.
20. Service Server will decrypt the 1st message from the previous 2 messages by its Secret Key.
21. From that Service Server will get the Client-Server Key.
22. With that decrypted Client-Server Key Service Server will decrypt the 2nd message from the previous 2 messages. From that it will get the Client.
23. Now the Service Server will Compare the Client details got from the 1st message and the 2nd messages from the previous 2 messages.

24. If Matched, Connection Established Successfully.
